# ChurnScope â€“ Full Stack Churn Prediction App

ChurnScope is an end-to-end machine learning web application that predicts customer churn across three industries: **Telecom**, **Retail**, and **Banking**.

Built with a **React frontend** and a **Django REST backend**, the app provides real-time predictions using trained ML models. Each model was built, evaluated, and saved for integration with the backend API.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for many industries. This app provides:

- Predictions for whether a customer will churn
- Separate models and inputs for **Telecom**, **Retail**, and **Banking**
- Backend preprocessing for consistent feature formatting
- Real-time API inference with user-friendly UI
